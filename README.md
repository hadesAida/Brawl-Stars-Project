About the project
Brawl Stars Info Hub is a web application built with Angular. It allows users to view detailed information about Brawl Stars characters and add new ones. Each character has a profile with a name, class, image, description, rarity, title, super ability, facts, and tips.

Characters are divided into two main categories: "Shelter" and "Favorites". The project currently works on the front-end side using local data. Backend integration is planned in future stages.
